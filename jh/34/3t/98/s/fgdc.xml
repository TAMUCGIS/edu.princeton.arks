        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI for Data &amp; Maps 2002: Created a data set by extracting populated places from U.S. Bureau of the Census 2000 Summary File 1 (SF1).  Ran ArcView command Add Event Theme on the data set to create the point location centroids shapefile. Reformatted attributes and finalized attribute order.  Created ArcView legend file (.avl), ArcGIS&#8482; layer file (.lyr) file, projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
