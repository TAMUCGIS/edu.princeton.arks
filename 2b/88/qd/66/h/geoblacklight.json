  "dc_description_s": "\nThis shapefile includes arcs and  polygons that describe U.S. Geological\nSurvey defined geologic provinces of the World. Each province has a set of\ngeologic characteristics distinguishing it from surrounding provinces.\nThese characteristics may include the dominant lithologies, the age of the\nstrata, and the structural style. Some provinces include multiple\ngenetically-related basins. Offshore province boundaries are generally\ndefined by the 2000 meter bathymetric contour, but where appropriate are\ndefined by the 4000 meter bathymetric contour. In some cases province\nboundaries are delineated by political boundaries, as in the case of The\nUnited States and Canada, because United States petroleum resources were\nassessed separately by the U.S. Geological Survey. Provinces are\nclassified as either Priority or Boutique. A priority province is one of\n76 non-U.S. geologic provinces defined by the U.S. Geological Survey that\ntogether contain 95 percent of the world's non-U.S. known petroleum\nvolume. All priority provinces were analyzed for undiscovered\npetroleum-resources. A boutique province is a geologic province, other\nthan a priority province, as defined by the U.S. Geological Survey,\nconsidered for petroleum-resource assessment. Boutique provinces can be\nchosen for a variety of geologic, political, technical and geographic\nreasons. Resource-assessments are conducted by scientists of the U.S\nGeological Survey's World Petroleum Assessment 2000 by means of a\ncombination of Petroleum System analysis based on available geologic\ninformation, and statistical analysis of production and exploration\ninformation. Total petroleum systems are defined in provinces considered\nfor assessment analysis. Total petroleum systems are subdivided into\nAssessment Units. Assessment results from the analysis of assessment units\nand total petroleum systems are aggregated and allocated to geologic\nprovinces. Summary results are presented as attributes of this coverage.\n",
