      <abstract>U.S. Geographic Names Information System Cemeteries represents an automated inventory of the proper names and locations of physical and cultural geographic features located throughout the United States and its Territories.</abstract>
      <purpose>Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), of which U.S. Geographic Names Information System Cemeteries is a part, promotes geographic feature name standardization and serves as the Federal Government's repository of information regarding feature name spellings and applications for features in United States and its Territories. The names listed in the inventory can be published on Federal maps, charts, and in other documents.  The feature locative information has been used in emergency preparedness, marketing, site-selection and analysis, genealogical and historical research, and transportation routing applications.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:100,000.</supplinf>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>GNIS was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) to promote the standardization of feature names. GNIS is being compiled in phases.
 
GNIS Phase I data compilation and edit - Feature name and attribute data were collected from the largest-scale USGS topographic maps available. These data were compared to the records of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. This phase is complete.

GNIS Phase II data compilation and edit - Feature name and attribute data are collected from official state and local sources and other approved sources including historical maps and documents. This phase is not complete.

GNIS Maintenance program - Federal and state maintenance cooperators submit new and corrected data in conjunction with their mapping and geographical information system data maintenance programs. The GNIS has an active data gathering and maintenance program. A web-based data date entry and edit application allows authorized users to submit transaction data directly for validation and entry into the database, where it immediately becomes available to all web services and applications. A test and demonstration site is available. Government agencies at all levels are encouraged to join this program. Other organizations and individuals will be considered on a case basis.

Partnerships - the Geographic Names Project enters into partnerships with State names authorities and State and local GIS agencies to integrate name, location, and attribute data in the GNIS with State and local datasets. These partnerships utilize GIS and web technology to automate and simplify data maintenance, ensure data consistency, integrity, and accuracy, and meet the requirements of the Board on Geographic Names for national names standardization. Government agencies at all levels are encouraged to join this program. Other organizations and individuals will be considered on a case basis.</procdesc>
