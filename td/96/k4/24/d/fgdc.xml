    <descript>
      <abstract>Based on original Tuolumne County cadastral parcel data, which was digitized and rubbersheeted using Manatron software and assessors' record of survey maps starting in 1992, this feature class was spatially adjusted in ARCINFO Workstation using ARCEDIT in late 2002 to reflect more accurate locational data. This is the first generation of the overall spatially corrected parcel data.</abstract>
      <purpose>As a basic building block for county-wide analyses and mapping, the parcel feature class needed to be more spatially correct. Although continually updated, the original digital parcel data varied from plus/minus a few feet to plus/minus 1000 feet in locational accuracy. The County of Tuolumne cannot guarantee relatibility or suitability of this information. Original data was compiled from a variety of sources, and the spatial information has variable accuracy. The dataset is subject to routine and occasional updating, correcting, and other modification without notification.

You further understand and agree that Tuolumne County makes absolutely no warranty whatsoever, whether expressed or implied, as to the accuracy, thoroughness, value, quality, validity, suitability, condition or fitness for a particular purpose of the data or any programming used to obtain the data, nor as to whether the data is error-free, up-to-date, complete or based upon accurate or meaningful facts.

You agree that Tuolumne County shall not be liable to you for any liability, claim, loss, damage, injury or expense of any kind caused or alleged to be caused, directly or indirectly, by the inadequacy of data obtained from Tuolumne County, by any deficiency of Tuolumne County or your systems, by any delay or failure to provide service, or by any other interruption, disruption or loss to your operations.

      <supplinf>Because of many variations in locational accuracy, a quantum shift was not feasable. Using the 'ADJUST' process in ARCEDIT, a link feature class of 14,995 links was built for use in the spatial adjustment. The snapping coverage was set to the newly updated (2002) county Public Land Survey System (PLSS) framework. In addition, GPS- based roads were used as locational guides. Although this spatially adjusted feature class is improved, it still needs verification of individual parcel accuracy within each PLSS section and adjustment along the county boundaries. The integrity of the attribute table also needs to be verified.</supplinf>
