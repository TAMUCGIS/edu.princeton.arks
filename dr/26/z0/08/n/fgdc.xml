    <logic>This data set contains information arrived at by either or both quantitative (i.e. instrumental) and qualitative (i.e. historical) methods.  Earthquakes that occurred prior to seismographs are known only from written records, which often may provide contradictory information that has to be carefully examined and weighed.  Once seismographs were introduced and became more common in the early 1900's, the origin time and location were both more precisely and accurately determined but the compilation and evaluation of intensity reports was and still is a process that involves considerable subjectivity.  As a result, all attributes associated with a given earthquake should be considered provisional and subject to further revision.

No duplicate features are present.  The shapefile is exported using Avenue request ExportClean.  This request verifies and enforces the correctness of shapes.</logic>
    <complete>This data set contains information on significant, historical earthquakes that caused deaths, property damage, geological effects, or that were experienced by populations in the epicentral area, for the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  These data are limited to the best estimates of earthquake locations and attributes such as magnitude and maximum intensity, brief descriptions of the earthquake, and in some cases, illustrations and maps showing the extent of the earthquake effects.

After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was calculated from latitude/longitude coordinates. For recent earthquakes, 100 meters is the nominal precision of the reported coordinate values but accuracy is significantly less. For recent earthquakes, accuracy depends upon numerous factors including imprecision of the velocity model of the earth, uneven distribution of seismic stations, and imprecisions in the computational algorithm.  For earlier earthquakes, accuracy drops considerably more.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>Although depths are reported to the nearest 1 km, the accuracy for recent earthquakes is considerably less owing to uncertainties in the velocity model of the earth, uneven distribution of seismic stations, and imprecisions in the computational algorithm.   For earlier earthquakes, accuracy drops considerably more.</vertaccr>

        <procdesc>M. Hopper transferred the significant and historic earthquake data from Stover and Coffman 1993 to entries in the FileMaker Pro database program for Macintosh (Claris).  Considerable editing of the file, including spell checking, was done in FileMaker Pro.  The data set was reduced to include just those earthquakes that had a Modified Mercalli (MM) intensity of VI or greater or magnitude 7.0 or greater in Alaska.

The data set was supplemented with damaging earthquakes that were not listed in Stover and Coffman 1993.  These additional events were principally located in adjacent Mexican States, Canadian Provinces, and in the Caribbean near Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The data set was additionally supplemented with large and (or) damaging earthquakes that met the selection criteria of the earlier process steps, for the period 1990 through September 1996 from the online data archive of the National Earthquake Information Center (http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/epic/epic.html) in early 1997.  Since recent earthquake data are sometimes revised due to new processing methods and additional input data, the earthquake parameters currently reported in the data archive for the period 1990 through September 1996 may differ slightly from the parameters used in this data set.

The file was exported from File Maker Pro on the Macintosh to the UNIX platform. The data file was converted into an ARC/Info point coverage using TRANSLATOR.AML; the attributes were transferred at the same time. The coverage was loaded into ArcView and converted to Shapefile format.</procdesc>
