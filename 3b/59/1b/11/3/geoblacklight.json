The sequence of the three-character FSA is always Alphabetical character/Number/Alphabetical character. The centroids are calculated from the DMTI Spatial FSA boundary file, which is created from the DMTI Spatial six-character postal code point file and CanMapÂ®. The FSA boundaries encompass the six-character postal code points starting with that FSA designation, and conform to the streets and other physical features within CanMap.",
