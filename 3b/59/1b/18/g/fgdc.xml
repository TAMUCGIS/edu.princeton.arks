    Section 2 to Customer Groups identified by you at the time you acquire

    Base                          Up to five

    the number of individuals using the Product, for purposes of 
    determining compliance with the table above. If a Customer Group is 
    involved in multiple Joint Projects, the Customer Group will be 
    counted as multiple sublicensees, based on the number of Joint Projects
    involved, for purposes of determining compliance with the table above.

    under Section 2 to any independent contractor hired by you to perform 
    customization services for the Product.

    Agreement, (ii) the sublicense is limited to using the Product solely 
    for the purposes of the Joint Project or for purposes of performing the
    customization services, and (iii) you are responsible for any

    this Agreement shall be deemed to be your breach of this Agreement. 
 
4.  Prohibited Use. You recognize and agree that the Product is the 
    property of DigitalGlobe and contains valuable assets and proprietary

 a. Use the Product or Derivative Works for any purpose not expressly 
    permitted under this Agreement, including without limitation for 
    Commercial Exploitation; 

 b. Sell, license, rent, transfer, give away, disclose, copy or reproduce 
    (even if merged with other materials), create Derivative Works of,

    by DigitalGlobe and its suppliers.  This Agreement does not 
    grant you title to the Product or any copies of the Product.

    and proprietary information of DigitalGlobe ("Confidential

    who are under a duty of confidentiality no less restrictive than your 
    duty hereunder. You will protect the Confidential Information 
    from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as you 
    protect your own confidential or proprietary information of similar 
    nature and with no less than reasonable care.

    are using the Product consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

    used in accordance with this Agreement. 
 
8.  Term and Termination.  This Agreement remains in full force until 
    terminated as provided below.  DigitalGlobe has the right to terminate 
    this Agreement, effective immediately upon notice to you, if you breach
    any provision of this Agreement.  Upon termination of this Agreement, 
    all rights granted to you hereunder shall immediately cease.  You and 
    your sublicensees will (i) discontinue all use of the Product; (ii) if 
    the product was delivered on a tangible medium, return to DigitalGlobe 
    the Product and all copies thereof; (iii) purge all copies of the 
    Product or any portion thereof from all computer storage device or 
    medium on which you have placed or permitted others to place the 
    Product; and (iv) give DigitalGlobe a written certification that you 
    have complied with all of your obligations hereunder.  

9.  Limited Warranty.  DigitalGlobe warrants that for a period of thirty 
    (30) days after delivery, the Product will perform substantially in 
    accordance with its applicable specification.  DigitalGlobe's sole 
    obligation and your entire remedy for breach of the above warranty is 
    for DigitalGlobe, at its option and expense, to (i) repair or replace 
    the non-conforming Product returned during the warranty period; 
    or (ii) refund all fees paid by for the non-conforming Product returned
    during the warranty period.
  
    EXCEPT AS PROVIDED ABOVE, THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY 
    WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND ALL WARRANTIES OF 
    MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
    ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.  DIGITALGLOBE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE 
    PRODUCT WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS OR EXPECTATIONS, OR THAT OPERATIONS OF 
    THE PRODUCT WILL BE ERROR FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED. 
 
    The limited warranty is void if any non-conformity has resulted from 
    accident, abuse, misuse, misapplication, or modification by any person 
    other than DigitalGlobe.    

10. Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT WILL DIGITALGLOBE OR ITS 
    SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, 
    EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS 
    AND LOST DATA) ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE 
    PRODUCT, EVEN IF DIGITALGLOBE OR ITS SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. DIGITALGLOBE AND ITS SUPPLIERS' TOTAL 
    CUMULATIVE LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE PRODUCT, 
    WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF 
    LICENSE FEES PAID TO DIGITALGLOBE FOR THE PRODUCT.  THIS SECTION SHALL 
    BE GIVEN FULL EFFECT EVEN IF THE WARRANTIES PROVIDED IN SECTION 9 IS 
    DEEMED TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  

11. Export Control.  You will not export or re-export the Software in 
    violation of the U.S. Export Administration regulations or other 
    applicable laws and regulations.  You will defend, indemnify, 
    and hold harmless DigitalGlobe from and against all fines, penalties, 
    liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses incurred by DigitalGlobe as 
    a result of any violation of such laws and regulations by you or any 
    of your agents or employees.

12.    Miscellaneous Terms.

 a. You acknowledge that any actual or threatened breach of Section 2, 4, 
    or 6 will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to DigitalGlobe for 
    which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that 
    injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such breach.  If any 
    action is brought to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party will 
    be entitled to receive its reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, 
    and other collection expenses, in addition to any 
    other relief it may receive.

 b. Failure to require performance of any provision of this Agreement does 
    not waive DigitalGlobe's right to subsequently require full and proper 
    performance of such provision.  If any provision of this Agreement is 
    determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of 
    this Agreement shall continue to be valid and enforceable.
  
 c. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder 
    may be assigned or transferred by you without the prior written consent
    of DigitalGlobe.  This restriction on assignment or transfer shall 
    apply to assignments or transfers by operation of law, as well 
    as by contract, merger or consolidation.  Any attempted assignment or 
    transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.

 d. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado,
    U.S.A., without regard to conflicts of law principles that would 
    require the application of the laws of any other state or jurisdiction.
    The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale 
    of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.  Any action 
    or proceeding arising from or relating to this Agreement must be 
    brought in a federal court or a state court in Boulder County, 
    Colorado, and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction 
    and venue of any such court in any such action or proceeding.

 e. The software portion of the Product is "commercial item" as that term 
    is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer 
    software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such 
    terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212.  Any technical data provided with 
    or included in the Product is "commercial technical data" as defined 
    in 48 C.F.R. 12.211. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.211 through 12.212, 
    48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, and 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7015, 
    all U.S. Government end users acquire the Product with only those     
    rights set forth therein.

 f. This Agreement represents the entire agreement between you and 
    DigitalGlobe as to the matters set forth herein and integrates all 
    prior discussions and understanding between us.  Your acceptance of 
    this Agreement is expressly limited to the terms and conditions set 
    forth herein; any additional or inconsistent terms provided by you in 
    any other documents such as a purchase order will not have any legally 
    binding effect.  This Agreement may be modified only by a binding 
    written instrument entered into by you and DigitalGlobe.
